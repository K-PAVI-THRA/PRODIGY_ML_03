# PRODIGY_ML_03

I have implemented a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model as part of Task-03: "Implement a support vector machine (SVM) to classify images of cats and dogs from the Kaggle dataset." The goal of this task was to develop a machine learning model capable of accurately classifying images as either cats or dogs using the SVM algorithm. The dataset used was sourced from Kaggle, and it contains images of both cats and dogs.

#### Dataset
The dataset for this task can be found here: [Kaggle Dogs vs Cats](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/dogs-vs-cats/data). It includes the images used in the SVM model for both training and testing.

#### Steps for Using the Dataset
1. Download the training and testing zip files from the provided Kaggle link.
2. Upload the zip files to your Google Drive in a folder called **Datasets** to keep things organized.
3. Open Google Colab and mount your Google Drive by adding a code cell above the existing code in the provided `.ipynb` file.
4. Follow the instructions in the `.ipynb` file to run the code.

**Note**: It's important to use the train and test zip files from Kaggle, as they contain a larger set of images, which helps improve the model's accuracy.

#### Code Execution
The code is available in the `SVM_Cat_vs_Dog_Classification.ipynb` file. After completing the setup, execute the code to train the SVM model on the images provided in the training and test datasets.

### Knowledge Gained

1. **Image Preprocessing**: I learned how to preprocess image data, including resizing, converting to grayscale, and flattening images for machine learning models. This experience helped me handle different image formats and organize data efficiently for training.

2. **Data Handling and Augmentation**: I gained skills in loading and managing image datasets, including extracting labels from filenames. I also tackled challenges related to class imbalance and dataset preparation, recognizing the importance of a balanced dataset for effective classification.

3. **Support Vector Machines (SVM) Implementation**: I implemented an SVM classifier using scikit-learn to distinguish between cats and dogs. I experimented with various SVM kernels, particularly the linear kernel, and explored how different kernels affected model performance.

4. **Model Evaluation and Metrics**: I learned how to evaluate the performance of the SVM model using metrics like accuracy and classification reports. This helped me understand the importance of evaluating model effectiveness in classification tasks.

5. **Label Encoding and Handling**: I gained experience in encoding categorical labels into a numerical format using `LabelEncoder`, a crucial step for training machine learning models with categorical data.

6. **Error Handling and Debugging**: I developed skills in debugging and troubleshooting errors related to data loading, preprocessing, and model training. I successfully identified and resolved issues such as data inconsistencies and class imbalances.

7. **Practical Application of Machine Learning**: This task allowed me to apply theoretical concepts of machine learning, specifically SVMs, to a real-world image classification problem. It enhanced my understanding of the end-to-end process of training and evaluating machine learning models.

8. **Experience with Google Colab and Cloud Storage**: I utilized Google Colab for implementing and running the code, gaining valuable experience with cloud-based tools and integrating them with cloud storage solutions.
